# Danny-s-Dinner

This project is part of the 8-week SQL challenge by Data With Danny, featuring a fictional restaurant called Danny's Diner. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and generate insights using raw transactional data. The dataset includes information on menu items, customer visits, and purchases.

In this case study, I used SQL to explore and answer a series of business questions related to:

Customer visit frequency and patterns

Popular menu items and order history

Revenue analysis and product trends

First-time and repeat customer behavior

Ranking and segmentation of customer preferences

The project showcases practical SQL skills such as JOINs, CTEs, window functions, aggregation, and date-based filtering to solve real-world business problems.
